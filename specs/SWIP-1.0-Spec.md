# Synheart Wellness Impact Protocol (SWIP-1.0)
### *Measuring the Physiological Impact of Digital Experiences*

> “Technology should adapt to human physiology, not the other way around.”

---

## Status of This Memo
This document defines **SWIP-1.0**, the first release of the **Synheart Wellness Impact Protocol**, a specification for measuring and certifying the physiological effects of digital applications based on heart-rate variability (HRV) and related biosignals.

SWIP-1.0 represents the first unified version for implementation by developers, researchers, and device manufacturers.

---

## Abstract
The **Synheart Wellness Impact Protocol (SWIP-1.0)** establishes an open, cross-platform framework that enables applications to **quantitatively assess their impact on human wellness** using biosignal-based metrics.

By integrating the **SWIP SDK**, developers can capture anonymized heart-rate and HRV data from wearable or phone sensors, analyze session-level changes, and determine whether user interactions produce **beneficial, neutral, or harmful physiological outcomes.**

SWIP’s purpose is twofold:
1. **Measurement** — to provide an objective, reproducible way to evaluate how software affects users’ autonomic balance (via HRV-derived metrics such as ΔHRV, Coherence Index, and Stress-Recovery Rate).  
2. **Accountability** — to create a transparent ecosystem where any app that claims to enhance focus, calm, or well-being can **prove it empirically** and earn a *Heart-Verified Certification (HVC).*

By doing so, SWIP redefines “digital wellness” from a marketing term into a measurable scientific standard, paving the way for ethical, bio-aligned technologies.

> “The heart is the most honest sensor. If our machines can feel its rhythm, they can finally serve humanity instead of consuming it.”

## 1. Motivation
Most “wellness” applications claim to make people healthier, calmer, or more focused—but few can **prove** those outcomes in measurable, physiological terms.  
The lack of a common verification layer means that *digital wellness* remains subjective, with no objective way to test whether a product truly benefits the human body.

At the same time, wearable sensors and heart-rate data are now widely available across Apple, Samsung, Fitbit, Garmin, and others.  
These devices capture signals—especially **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)**—that directly reflect the state of the **autonomic nervous system**, the physiological foundation of stress, recovery, and emotional balance.

SWIP-1.0 was created to bridge this gap between **digital behavior** and **biological response**.  
It defines how apps should measure, analyze, and report their HRV impact so that developers, researchers, and even regulators can speak a shared, scientific language about *how technology affects human coherence.*

> **Goal:** To make every app accountable to the human body.

## 2. Protocol Architecture

### 2.1 Overview
The SWIP architecture defines the data flow from **sensor → SDK → analyzer → result** in a secure, privacy-preserving manner.

```
[ Wearable / Sensor ]
        ↓
[ SWIP SDK ]
        ↓
[ HRV Processor ]
        ↓
[ Impact Engine ]
        ↓
[ Wellness Impact Report ]
```

Each layer has a defined role:

| Layer | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Sensor Interface** | Streams heart-rate and RR interval data from supported devices (HealthKit, Google Fit, BLE). |
| **SWIP SDK** | Lightweight client library for mobile or embedded environments. Handles consent, buffering, feature extraction, and communication. |
| **HRV Processor** | Filters noise and calculates time- and frequency-domain HRV features (SDNN, RMSSD, LF/HF ratio). |
| **Impact Engine** | Compares session metrics against rolling baselines and computes a **Wellness Impact Score (WIS)**. |
| **Report Layer** | Returns the evaluated result (`beneficial`, `neutral`, or `harmful`) with confidence intervals. |

### 2.2 Data Lifecycle
1. **Consent & Context Initialization** — user grants permission; app defines session context.  
2. **Signal Acquisition** — continuous HR/RR collection incl. pre/post windows.  
3. **Feature Extraction** — RMSSD, SDNN, LF/HF, mean HR; optional motion.  
4. **Impact Evaluation** — ΔHRV, Coherence Index (CI), Stress-Recovery Rate (SRR) → WIS.  
5. **Reporting & Feedback** — local-only (default) or optional cloud benchmarking.

### 2.3 Computation Reference
Let $HRV_{pre}$ and $HRV_{post}$ be pre/post RMSSD; $CI = \frac{LF}{LF+HF}$; $SRR$ recovery time.

$$\Delta HRV = HRV_{post} - HRV_{pre}$$

$$WIS = w_1(\Delta HRV) + w_2(CI) + w_3(-SRR)$$

Classification thresholds:

| WIS Range | Interpretation |
|------------|----------------|
| > +0.2 | **Beneficial** — improved coherence |
| −0.2 ≤ WIS ≤ +0.2 | **Neutral** — negligible change |
| < −0.2 | **Harmful** — decreased coherence or stress induction |

### 2.4 Architecture Goals
- **Universality** across devices  
- **Transparency** via open-source math  
- **Privacy-first** local computation  
- **Ethical Use** (no manipulation)  
- **Extensibility** to multimodal signals

### 2.5 Design Philosophy
> “Measure, don’t manipulate.”

## 3. Core HRV Metrics and Evaluation Model

### 3.1 Purpose
The heart’s rhythm provides a continuous, non-verbal record of autonomic response. SWIP-1.0 standardizes three measures that describe whether an app supports or strains physiological balance.

### 3.2 Primary Metrics

| Symbol | Name | Description | Typical Window |
|---------|------|--------------|----------------|
| **ΔHRV** | **HRV Delta** | Difference between pre-session and post-session RMSSD. | 1–3 min pre / 1–3 min post |
| **CI** | **Coherence Index** | Ratio of low-frequency to total HRV power: $CI = \tfrac{LF}{LF + HF}$. | 60 s rolling |
| **SRR** | **Stress-Recovery Rate** | Time (s) for HRV to return to baseline after session end. | up to 5 min post |

### 3.3 Feature Extraction Reference

**RMSSD**  
$$RMSSD = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^{N-1}(RR_{i+1} - RR_i)^2}$$

**SDNN**  
$$SDNN = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N}(RR_i - \bar{RR})^2}$$

**LF/HF Bands**

| Band | Range (Hz) | Interpretation |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| VLF | 0.003–0.04 | Thermoregulation / long-term trends |
| LF | 0.04–0.15 | Baroreflex / sympathetic + parasympathetic |
| HF | 0.15–0.40 | Parasympathetic (vagal) tone |

Spectral density may use **Welch** or **Lomb–Scargle** depending on sampling.

### 3.4 Normalization Across Devices
1. **RR Validation** — reject RR < 300 ms or > 2000 ms; remove >20% jumps.  
2. **Resampling** — interpolate RR to 4 Hz for frequency analysis.  
3. **Calibration Constants** — device coefficient $k_{device}$: $HRV_{norm} = k_{device} \times HRV_{raw}$.  
4. **Personal Baseline** — rolling 24 h mean and std; compute z-scores.

### 3.5 Wellness Impact Score (WIS)
$$WIS = w_1(\Delta HRV_z) + w_2(CI_z) + w_3(-SRR_z)$$  
Defaults: $w_1=0.5, w_2=0.3, w_3=0.2$.

### 3.6 Classification Thresholds
Same as Section 2.3; confidence from signal quality, duration, baseline completeness.

### 3.7 Extended Metrics (Optional)
Emotional Stability Score (ESS), Energy Balance Index (EBI), Multimodal Coherence (HRV+respiration+EDA).

### 3.8 Validation
Implementations must match reference within **±5% RMSSD** and **±10% LF/HF** on **SWIP-WRD-1**.
