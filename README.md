# Synheart Wellness Impact Protocol (SWIP)

> "Technology should adapt to human physiology, not the other way around."

The **Synheart Wellness Impact Protocol (SWIP)** is an open, cross-platform framework that enables applications to quantitatively assess their impact on human wellness using biosignal-based metrics.

## Overview

SWIP provides developers with the tools to:
- Capture anonymized heart-rate and HRV data from wearable or phone sensors
- Analyze session-level changes in physiological metrics
- Determine whether user interactions produce beneficial, neutral, or harmful physiological outcomes
- Earn **Heart-Verified Certification (HVC)** for apps that demonstrably enhance user wellness

## Current Status

**ðŸš§ In Development** - This project is currently in early development phase.

### What's Available
- âœ… **SWIP-1.0 Specification** - Complete protocol definition
- âœ… **Flutter SDK** - Basic implementation with synheart_wear integration
- âœ… **Project Structure** - Organized repository with proper documentation
- âœ… **CI/CD Pipeline** - GitHub workflows for testing and validation

### What's Coming
- ðŸ”„ **iOS SDK** - Native iOS implementation
- ðŸ”„ **Android SDK** - Native Android implementation  
- ðŸ”„ **React Native SDK** - React Native implementation
- ðŸ”„ **HRV Validator** - Data validation tools
- ðŸ”„ **SWIP CLI** - Command-line certification client
- ðŸ”„ **SWIP Simulator** - Test data generation

## Quick Start (Flutter)

```dart
import 'package:swip/swip.dart';

final swip = SWIPManager();
await swip.initialize();

final sessionId = await swip.startSession(
  config: SWIPSessionConfig(
    duration: Duration(minutes: 30),
    type: 'baseline',
    platform: 'flutter',
    environment: 'indoor',
  ),
);

final results = await swip.endSession();
print('Wellness Impact Score: ${results.wellnessScore}');
```
